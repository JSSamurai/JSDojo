# JSDojo
JavaScript Dojo is a theme for Microsoft's Open-Source editor Visual Studios Code (aka VS-Code). JavaScript was the main focus for JSDojo when it was being developed, however; I am currently working on the support of other machine languages. DojoJS uses semantic highlighting, a feature that developers didn't have available to them when creating themes for VS Code before 2018. This is a contemporary theme, it looks good and feels good. Currently supported is HTML(And any other MarkUp languages), Markdown, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, dot-txt, dot-log, and as stated am currently working on adding support for more.
